# Typography & Interaction – Project 1

This project was created for my Typography & Interaction course at Parsons. It explores the relationship between a reading selection of my choice and the response I crafted in a single interactive webpage.

## Readings
The central reading is:
- Kristen Coogan, *Knowing Your Design History is Crucial to Aesthetic Innovation* (Eye Magazine)

I built my site to present significant parts of the article with my personal reflection on the subject matter, learning how historical fluency in design shapes contemporary practices.

## How I Made It
- **HTML5 semantic structure** (`header`, `main`, `article`, `section`, `aside`, `footer`) to create a clean and accessible reading experience.
- **CSS styling** with a reset and custom stylesheet for typography hierarchy, layout, and emphasis.
- Internal navigation (`<nav>`) for quick jumps between article, response, and about sections.
- Experimentation with semantic elements like `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`, and `<time>` to enrich the document meaning.
- I felt that the typefaces I used were perfect for this article piece, because they have small, minor inconsistensies that reflect how I feel about history in general. And as we all know, history is never perfect and we choose to learn from it.

## Things I Want to Remember
- Always use semantic HTML where possible, because it is better for accessibility, SEO, and long-term maintainability.
- Keep one `<h1>` for the page and use `<h2>`/`<h3>` for structured hierarchy.
- Writing a README is a good GitHub practice that I did not realize the importance of prior: it documents what the project is, how it was built, and why it matters.
- For future improvements, this structure could definitely be extended into more interactive experiments (scroll effects, responsive typography, etc.).
- When I last worked on a project with CSS, I used to love playing with different types of subtle motion graphics. It was difficult learning the syntax again, but I'm glad it turned out better than I had hoped. I need to keep pushing myself to try different things, and I hope I can in future projects too!
